        "\n",
        "In the pursuit of optimizing factorial computation, we implemented two dynamic programming techniques: memoization and tabulation. The primary objective was to determine the most efficient algorithm as the input size (n) increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Memoization Approach:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The memoization approach exhibited impressive performance, especially for moderate values of n. By caching previously computed results, redundant calculations were minimized, leading to faster execution times. This efficiency was evident in tests for n values up to 1000, where the memoization approach outperformed tabulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tabulation Approach:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Tabulation, employing a bottom-up iterative strategy, showcased consistent efficiency as n increased. The algorithm demonstrated resilience in handling larger input sizes, and its linear time complexity contributed to its steady performance. Notably, the tabulation approach was able to compute factorial for n = 5000 without encountering the recursion depth limit observed in the memoization approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Observations at n = 5000:**\n",
        "\n",
        "When n was set to 5000, the memoization approach encountered a RecursionError due to the maximum recursion depth being exceeded. In contrast, the tabulation approach executed successfully, albeit with a higher execution time of 11.814932 seconds.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "As the input size grows, the limitations associated with recursion depth become a critical factor. In this context, the tabulation approach proves to be the more robust and scalable solution. Its linear time complexity ensures steady performance, and it does not face the recursion depth challenges seen in the memoization approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while memoization exhibits efficiency for smaller inputs, tabulation emerges as the superior algorithm for large values of n, providing a reliable and scalable solution for factorial computation."
